<p style = "margin-left: calc((100% - 600px) * 0.5); margin-top: 40px; width: 600px; ">I made the film 云之味 (Flavor of Yunnan) for the semester-long Visual Anthropology project. It is a thirteen-minute-long ethnography film about the Wa girl 李芸熙 (Li Yunxi) working as an entertaining and greeting performer in Cai Ni Yunnan Ethnic Cuisine Restaurant.
As a Yunnanese and a member of the ethnic minority, I have experienced and enjoyed the performances a couple of times when I was eating in the restaurant and other branches as well. So I decided to make a film about them. But through the making of the film, when I once again seeing customers taking pictures of the performers, and kids playing with them, I have a mixed feeling.</p>
