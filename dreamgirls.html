<p style = "margin-left: calc((100% - 600px) * 0.5); margin-top: 40px; width: 600px; ">From the dressing room to the stage, this film follows four of Shanghai’s prominent drag performers: Kimberly Kumswell, Mo Meaux, Fantasia Valentina, and Ennis FW. We talk to one of Shanghai’s biggest MC’s in the drag scene, Kimberly, who has performed in the drag capital, NYC, but prefers Shanghai for its unique, close-knit community. Mo Meaux, a professional dancer, moved to Shanghai with a dance company, starting out in the high-end club circuit, making her way to teaching dance classes in a studio. Fantasia, from Zhejiang, China, talks about navigating Shanghai drag scene that is largely dominated by expat performers and how Chinese culture influences the scene. Shanghai’s first drag king, Ennis FW, puts on her final performance in Shanghai as she is returning to the states for grad school because she doesn’t feel fully incorporated into Shanghai life since she doesn’t speak Chinese. All four of the performers have played a large role in evolving the Shanghai drag scene.</p>
